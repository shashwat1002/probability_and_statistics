## Motivation of baye's theorem 

Consider this: 
- We can easily calculate the probability of having the word "dear" given I know it is spam
- baye's theorem allows



# Baye's theorem

For any events $E$ and $F$ where $P(E) > 0$ and $P(F)>0$

$$
P(E|F) = \frac{P(F|E) P(E)}{P(F)}
$$

Why does this work?

$P(E|F) P(F) = P(F \cap F)$

and by definition we know that $P(E|F) = \frac{P(E \cap F)}{P(F)}$


Further expansion can happen 

$$
P(E) = (P(E|F) P(F) + P(E|F^c) P(F^c))
$$



## Monty Hall problem statement 

- there are three doors
- one door leads to a car, the other two leads to goats.
- you can pick a door _without_ opening it 
- then host opens a door 
- if the host always opens a goat door, is it wise to change the door.


The decision of changing choice feels like a 0.5 chance and that it hardly matters.

### Bayes theorem solution 

- Let $H$ be the hypothesis "door 1 has a car behind it" and $E$ is the evidence that Monty has revealed a door with a goat behind it. 

- Then problem can be restated as finding the value of $P(H|E)$ because that will determine the decision of switching. 

$$
P(H) = \frac{1}{3}
$$

$$
P(H^c) = 1 \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}
$$

$$
P(E) = 1
$$

Also, 

$$
P(E | H) = 1
$$

(Note: $P(E)$ and $P(E | H) = 1$ are $1$ because we know that the host will always open a door with the goat, no matter what.)

By Bayes theorem we can say that 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(H | E) & = \frac{P(E | H) P(H)}{P(E)} \\
    & = \frac{1 \cdot P(H)}{1} \\
    & = P(H) \\
    & = \frac{1}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

This basically tells us that no matter the evidence, the probability I had chosen the right door the first time, doesn't change. Meaning that the chance that I picked the right door is $\frac{1}{3}$. Thus it is more likely that my door is wrong. Since one door has been removed from commission, we can say that the left door has a $\frac{2}{3}$ probability of having a car.


Note: you don't have to pick door one the first time round, you can pick any without the loss of generality for the proof.
