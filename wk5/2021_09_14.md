# Definition of Independence 

Two events $E$ and $F$ are defined to be independent if

$$
P(E \cap F) = P(E) P(F)
$$

If $E$ and $F$ are independent then 

$$
P(E | F) = P(E)
$$






## Can $A$ and $B$ be both mutually exclusive and independent? 

Naah 

I will disprove the proposition "Two events $A$ and $B$ can be both mutually excusive and independent" using proof by contradiction

Assuming that both $A$ and $B$ are possible (i.e. non-zero probability)

Assuming that $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive and independent.



We get 
$$
A \cap B = \phi
$$
and
$$
P(A \cap B) = 0
$$
Since they're also independent, we know:
$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
$$
and thus 
$$
P(A) \cdot P(B) = 0
$$
meaning 

$P(A) = 0 \lor P(B) = 0$ which contradicts the assumption that both the events are possible.
